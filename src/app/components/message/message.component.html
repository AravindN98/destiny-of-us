      This website isn’t just code and colors
      it’s a small piece of my heart,  
      made just for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let me start from the beginning.  
      It all started with a text on <strong>September 1st at 8:44 PM 💗</strong>.  
      It was just a “Hey”… and now we’re here,  
      holding so many feelings and memories together.
    </p>

    <p>
      I truly believe it was God’s plan that we met at the right time.  
      We were both at a low phase of life,  
      and somehow found strength in each other
      growing, healing, becoming better than before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Somewhere between our conversations,  
      your laughter, and the way you treat me so gently,  
      you became someone my heart chose quietly💕
    </p>

    <p>
      You make me laugh when I don’t feel like smiling,  
      and somehow… you feel like home.
    </p>

    <p class="highlight">
      If you’re smiling right now
      I win 😄💖
    </p>

    <p>
      Every moment with you feels like home.  
      Your smile makes ordinary days beautiful,  
      and your presence turns silence into comfort.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are the calm in my chaos,  
      the smile I look for on hard days,  
      and the thought that stays  
      even when everything else fades.
    </p>

    <p class="closing">
      If you ever wonder how special you are to me…  
      just remember
      <strong>Babe, I built this thinking only of you ❤️</strong>
