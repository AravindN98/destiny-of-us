    <h2>Destiny</h2>

    <p class="opening">
      I may not be perfect,  
      but loving you feels like the perfect thing I have done💖
    </p>

     <p>
      I want to apologise if I ever hurted you or ever made you feel bad means.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are the girl I crave for all the time. The vibe we both share and the way we care for each other makes me fall for you more and more
    </p>

    <p>
      I know long distance relationship is not easy but the way we both are managing it is of just another level.
      It requires lot of trust and we trust each other lot💖
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes I insist you not to do certain things so it doesn't mean that I don't trust my girl, it is because I know how the men are and how the society is. 
      Am sorry if you ever felt bad for that reason means.
    </p>

    <p>
      Am really lucky to have an understanding girl like you💗
      And in this present world it is really difficult to safeguard my girl from creepy men but don't worry, you have your man by your side so I won't allow anyone to harm you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I promise to choose you,  
      not only on the easy, smiling days,  
      but even when life feels heavy  
      and the world feels too loud.
    </p>

    <p>
      I promise to listen when you speak,  
      understand when you feel,  
      and stand beside you  
      when you need strength more than words.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some people meet by chance,  
      some by coincidence  
      but some meetings are written quietly  
      long before they ever happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      From that first message,  
      to every moment that followed,  
      it always felt like something unseen  
      was gently guiding us toward each other.
    </p>

    <p class="highlight">
      Maybe it wasn’t luck.  
      Maybe it wasn’t timing.  
      Maybe it was destiny all along 💫
    </p>

    <p class="question">
     I love loving you, daily, deeply and endlessly💗
    </p>
